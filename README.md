# Changes Made to Course Site

Required Changes
----------------
1. Changed background of body to a lighter gray - rbg(197, 197, 197) and changed the footer div color to make it look the same as the header at the top. the exact color is #18453b
2. Changed the basic text font to Source Sans Pro and changed the font in the heading tags to PT Sans Caption.
3. Added an MSU Spartan image to the left and right side of the header tags. Also added a photo of Dr. John Monberg on the Contact page.
4. Used a table to format the grading scale on the Assignments page. Also added a title and made the points go in ascending order for easier readability.
5. Reformated the Student groups, changed the link color to the dark green to keep the theme, then added a brighter green on hover for readability. Didn't change the group names, because I thought that group 1-6 worked well. then set up a grid layout with grid-template-colums: 1fr 1fr 1fr 1fr; to space out eveyone's names.
6. Added navgation to the Schedule webpage.
7. Kept the columns the same on the schedule page because it makes sense how th information is laid out. It is very easy to see the information across multiple rows.
